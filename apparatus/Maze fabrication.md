* hot glue gun: “mini” 0.27 inch / 6.8 mm size, many model options 
* hot glue sticks: 
	* reversible: Adtech 229-110-25 Heat Glue Sticks -- [link](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/gp/product/B00OBC4CU2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* laser cutter 
	* NOTE: laser cutting PVC or other inappropriate materials can be potentially fatal!

# Design
* The walls are glued to the ceiling. The combination simply rests on the floor plate, which is a flat piece of acrylic. This way the floor can be cleaned easily of the debris that the animals leave beind.
* Slots are cut on a regular grid into the ceiling. The wall segments have pegs that fit into those slots. The arrangement of wall segments then defines the maze.
* The file `maze-design.DXF` can be used for laser cutting the ceiling and some sample walls. `maze-design.PDF` has the same content with a few dimensions and notes attached.

# Laser cutting instructions
1. make a small sample of slots and pegs to check that the wall thickness of your material fits snugly into the ceiling slots; it should be secure but not difficult to insert or remove
2. cut the cross pattern into the ceiling 
3. design all the wall segments to produce your desired maze layout.
4. refine wall lengths so that corners meet without obstructing one another
5. laser cut the pegged walls
6. place a small drop of glue on each wall peg and press the piece into the ceiling cut-outs
