# Laser cutting instructions
1. make a small sample to double check that the wall thickness fits snugly into the ceiling cross cut-outs; it should be secure but not difficult to insert or remove
2. cut the cross pattern into the ceiling 
3. refine wall peg sizes to fit snuggly into the ceiling holes
4. refine wall lengths so that corners meet without obstructing one another
4. cut the pegged walls
5. place a small drop of glue on each wall peg and press the piece into the ceiling cut-outs
